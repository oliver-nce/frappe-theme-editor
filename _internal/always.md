# Agent Rules

1. Confirm understanding of the request before proceeding
2. No code changes without explicit user approval
3. Start with highest-probability fixes (typos, config, paths) before complex solutions
4. Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
5. If anything is unclear or assumptions about existing code are wrong — STOP and ask
